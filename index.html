          <h3>Education</h3>  
          <p class="skill-row-para1"> I am a 2020 graduate of Liberty University out of Lynchburg, Virginia. However, I am currently located in southwest, Ohio. I graduated with my Bachelor's of Information Technology degree with a concentration in Web and Mobile programming.</p>
          <p>Examples of projects completed during this time were most notably my capstone project in my final semester. I was required to create, design, and implement and entirely new system/website. Work included use cases, project management, network systems diagrams, a fully functioning website and user accounts, as well as product inventory and checkout pages for products purchased.</p> 
          <p>This year, I am currently completing a full-stack web development bootcamp through Udemy with an antipated completion date in early 2023. The bootcamp courses include front-end languages, design and development concepts as well as back-end languages, and databases. Additional skills learned will cover Authentication and Security, React, API's and Deploying Web Applications.</p>

            <h3>Work Experience</h3>
            <p class="skill-row-para2">I take pride in my diverse work background and life history. Without realizing it at the time, my introduction to coding was actually with MySpace and editing my personal profile, which I loved. Not long thereafter, however, I made the poor decision to drop out of highschool with no direction in life and struggled early on through multiple part-time jobs.</p>
            <p>That is until I landed my first full-time job here in Ohio. I started as an administrative assistant for a small allied health college. However, I earned a promotion to Administrative Analyst due to my natural technical know-how. I went on to complete my associate's degree in Business Information systems, and was given the opportunity to overhaul the school's website. I completed this project entirely on my own and hand-coded most of the webpages from scratch using only HTML, CSS, as well as some Bootstrap and Javascript components. Certain features and design components of the website I built in 2017, are even still in use on the website today.</p>
            <p>After 5 years with the allied health college, I pivoted my career direction, started a family, and enrolled in school full-time. Just before finishing my final semester at Liberty University, I was recruited by an IT recruiting company for a full-time contract position within the banking industry as an IT Analyst for the Database Administration team where I learned SQL and all things databases. However, this position was not my preferred IT niche and not quite what I went to school for, so I ultimately left to take on a less demanding job in HR within the Benefits Department at a local freight company. At the time, this decision was best for my family dynamic. </p>
            <p>It was there that I really realized where my true passions lied and that was always with and still is with Web Development and Design. So, from there I enrolled in the bootcamp I'm currently in to refresh and learn new skills and languages. I've helped my husband with his company's website needs on the side and set off on my own web development career adventure with the goal of making this my full-time, lifelong career. </p>
